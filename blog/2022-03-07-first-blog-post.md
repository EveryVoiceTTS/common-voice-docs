# First Blog Post

This first blog post is just a stand-in for starting the blog feature of this website. I'm not sure we'll use it, though.

To disable the blog, delete all the files in in `/blog` and look for the two blocks preceded by "Comment out the following to disable the blog" in `/docusaurus.config.js`.

Test: an edit made by clicking on "Edit this page" on the website. This edit is made directly on `github.com`.
